# Regression-Models-Collection
Regression Models Collection

This repository contains implementations of seven major regression techniques in Python. Each model is presented in its own folder with a dedicated dataset, clean code, and usage instructions. It is designed as a learning and reference resource for students, data scientists, and developers exploring regression techniques.

This repository provides implementations of seven major regression techniques in Python, including Linear, Multiple, Polynomial, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Regression. Each model is organized in its own module with clean code, datasets, and instructions for use.

Models Included

Linear Regression – Basic linear relationship between independent and dependent variables.

Multiple Regression – Linear regression with multiple predictors.

Polynomial Regression – Captures non-linear relationships by transforming features.

Ridge Regression – Linear regression with L2 regularization to reduce overfitting.

Lasso Regression – Linear regression with L1 regularization for feature selection.

Elastic Net Regression – Combines L1 and L2 regularization.

Datasets

Each model folder contains its own dataset tailored to demonstrate that specific regression technique.

Datasets are included directly within each subfolder, so you can run each model independently.

Replace the provided datasets with your own data to experiment.

Support Vector Regression (SVR) – Uses support vector machines for regression tasks.
